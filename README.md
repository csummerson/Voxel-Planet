# Overview

This game was created for my CS599 final project. It is a solar system demo with the ability to travel to each planet and deform voxel terrain, mainly focused on **User Interaction**.

# Controls
- Click a planet to travel there
- Use WASD to move around, SHIFT to go down, SPACE to go up.
- LEFT CLICK to break terrain, RIGHT CLICK to add terrain.
- DOUBLE SPACE to switch between Debug and Physical mode.
- Press X to return to the solar system map.

# Features
- Voxel generation around the origin of a planet
- Naive surface nets to extract the isosurface of the plant
- Deformable terrain of the voxels
- Atmospheric shader to approximate Rayleigh Scattering
- Debug and physics based motion orbiting each planet
- Solar system simulator to allow a player to select which planet to visit
