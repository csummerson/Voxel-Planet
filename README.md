# Overview

This game was created for my CS599 final project. It is a solar system demo with the ability to travel to each planet and deform voxel terrain.

# Features
- Voxel generation around the origin of a planet
- Naive surface nets to extract the isosurface of the plant
- Deformable terrain of the voxels
- Atmospheric shader to approximate Rayleigh Scattering
- Debug and physics based motion orbiting each planet
- Solar system simulator to allow a play to select which planet to visit
